"""
Assume that an array of integers of bigger than zero.
Write the code that returns the maximum value of difference between two numbers.

e.g.) Input: [2, 8, 19, 37, 4, 5, 12, 50, 1, 34, 23]
      Output: 49 (âˆµ 49 = 50-1, '50' is the biggest member and '1' is the smallest member.)

Note
1. Return a positive number, so not -49, but 49 must be returned in case of given example above.
2. The size of array is greater or the same with 2.
